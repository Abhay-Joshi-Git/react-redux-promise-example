# react-redux-promise-example
very basic example of using react-redux and redux-promise

```
To Start the Application

Run server - go to server repo - run npm install - node index.js

In main app - run npm install - npm start 
```

It uses redux-actions to generate action when promise gets resolved, simplified commented code is also present to give idea
